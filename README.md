Projects -

Car Insurance App

This is a simple app that allows the user to enter their information for a quote for an insurance policy. Based on several elements of the users age, car model, year and type, the program will calcuate an estimate for the user. In addition, an Admin view allows for the viewing of these created quotes, without exposing entry or details to the user.

Newsletter App

An example of a Newsletter sign up form. This form will take in user input and save their information to a database, and produce a success message when saved. In additon, if the user chooses to remove themselves from the mailing list, a view for the admin containing the datetime element of removal is created and saved to the database.

Twenty One Game

A quick, but inclusive console app of the popular casino game, 21 / Blackjack. This game contains several comprehensive elements, utilizing the majority of core C# building blocks. It also contains many filters to sanitize user input before using the data throughout the program.

Package Express App

Good News, Everyone! This console app will calculate your total shipping cost based on a number of parameters. Once the users input is converted to the int data type, it is then run through a an if else loop to determine if the item meets shipping requirements.
