TheatreCMS Project

A working example of a larger project utilizing the .Net Core and Entity framework. 

Utilizing an existing database, I was tasked with creating a Blog Author section with full CRUD functionality. In addition, it was important for me to maintain a consistant theme in both layout and color.

I acheived this by utilizing Bootstrap, and its acompanying toolkit. On the back end, I ensured that all data was correctly pulled, presented, and recorded in the database. This includes all pertinent details of the Author, as well as the time of Creation and time of Leaving ( when it occurs ).

 With the help of .cshtml and Razor syntax, I was able to create a partial view of the Blog Author details, and bring in the correct pages from the card navigation on the main content container.

In addition, I made sure to provide a neat footer at the bottom. With a few additional buttons, the user can easily navigate back to other views without needing to utilize the navigation at the top of the card. 


Future and Potential Improvements

While this project is a great exmaple of both front end and back end development, there are opportunities for improvement.

In addition to small UI adjustments, the implementation of linking in the BlogPhotos aspect of the project would fill out the author photos ( rather than the lovely placeholder kitten ). 


Thank you for checking out my project!
